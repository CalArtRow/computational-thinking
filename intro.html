        <h2>What is computational thinking?</h2>
        <img src="./img/question.jpg" alt="A dog appearing to raise a question">
        <p>It takes little more than a google search to see that definitions of computational thinking often relate to coding or programming. However, our understanding is that computational thinking is far more than just a component of programming or coding, it is a genuine fundamental skill that underpins the ability for individuals to tackle both real world and programming problems. According to Shute et al. (2017) computational thinking is defined as:</p>
        <blockquote>“The conceptual foundation required to solve problems effectively and efficiently (algorithmically, with or without the assistance of computers) with solutions that are reusable in different contexts.”</blockquote>
        <p>Essentially, computational thinking can be thought of as a method of thinking where you are able to take a large (and potentially unmanageable) problem and deconstruct it into smaller manageable sub problems and then construct a comprehendible sequence of instructions on how to complete them.</p>

        <h2>How can you think computationally?</h2>
        <img src="./img/how.jpg" alt="An aerial view of a puzzle">
        <h3>There is a consensus that there are 4 integral processes to carry out computational thinking: </h3>

            <div class="ct-shape">Decomposition</div>
            <div class="ct-shape">Pattern recognition</div>

        </div>
        <p><b>Decomposition</b> involves breaking down large complex problems into a series of smaller problems, that can be solved much more easily.</p>
        <p><b>Pattern recognition</b> involves looking for similarities between these decomposed problems. If a problem shares a pattern with a previous problem the same solution can be applied, whether that be within the same overarching problem or even between two completely different problems. This increases the efficiency of problem solving.</p>
        <p><b>Abstraction</b> involves filtering out irrelevant details so you can focus all efforts on the critical elements of the problem to solve it. Essentially, it allows us to form a clear idea of what the problem is by removing any detail that will not contribute to solving it. It is possible that if this process of abstraction doesn’t happen then we could end up with the wrong solution to the problem we were tasked with solving. </p>
        <p><b>Algorithm design </b>involves creating a step-by-step solution or a set of instructions to follow to solve the problem. To visualise algorithm design, we can create a flow chart which represents the process of solving the problem.</p>

        <h2>Why is it important to a computing degree and a future career?</h2>
        <img src="./img/code.jpg" alt="A typical working set up of someone in a computing career">
        <p>Computational thinking will ensure we get the most out of our learning as computer science students; decomposition can help us break down large assignments into manageable tasks. Pattern recognition will allow us to question whether any of the problems we face in assignments share qualities with problems we have already addressed in class, allowing us to apply a similar solution (possibly even the same function). Abstraction can be applied through being focused on the marking criteria for assignments, ensuring we are directing what we have learnt correctly in our work. Algorithm design can allow us to formulate a guide to tackle a large project such as a dissertation and preparing us for the step into employment. </p>
        <blockquote>"Computer scientists use technology to solve a range of different problems.”
            <br><cite>(Murdoch University, 2022)</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Every industry today includes an element of computing and the majority of companies employ computer scientists to ensure they function effectively in a digital society. As a computing graduate the nature of work in software engineering or development roles in any company will involve finding solutions to problems. These problems will not solely be ‘coding’ problems, they could be visual, functional or other more ‘real-world’ problems and could be as diverse as the industries they originate from. These problems could also be communicated by a client who could have little to no knowledge of computing or coding. Therefore, computational thinking will provide a blueprint to allow us to find solutions to these problems that can be implemented using our coding skills, in doing so bridging the gap between the narrow field of computer programming and the real-world problems that we will need to tackle as computer scientists.</p>

            <h2>What have I learnt from this module?</h2>
            <img src="./img/reflective_writing.jpg" alt="An individual writing at a desk">
            <p>The initial aim of the module was to establish what is meant by computational thinking. This was achieved through discussing the four primary processes involved in the method (decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction and algorithms) and then working through real-life examples. At first, I found the leap from how to decompose problems associated with everyday tasks (such as making a cup of tea etc.) to applying the same concept to the programming challenges we would tackle a struggle.</p>
            <h3>Pseudocode is important!</h3>
            <p>However, once we built on the basic programming concepts through working on language specific problems in another module, I was able to recognise the patterns between the two sets of (decomposed) problems even though they were not set in the same programming language and begin to apply the computational thinking processes effectively. This reinforced the value of writing pseudocode effectively, as it was essentially the same between the two sets of problems. I will ensure that I write out solutions to problems/challenges I encounter going forward in pseudocode as it will enable me to translate the solutions in to any coding language efficiently.</p>
            <h3>It is more important to be able to problem solve than code in a specific language</h3>
            <p>I am now more aware that rather than being able to program in a specific language, employers will be looking for applicants that will be able to apply computational thinking principles and solve problems effectively. This has enforced the need to practice problem solving challenges, which I will endeavour to do so by actively engaging in resources such as leetcode and codewars on a regular basis for the duration of the course.</p>
            <h3>It is better studying collaboritively</h3>
            <img src="./img/group_study.jpg" alt="A group of people working collaboritively">
            <p>I have typically considered myself better at studying academically individually. However, during the module I found that due to the problem-solving nature of the content I was gaining far more from the sessions when collaborating with others. This will be something I will need to remain conscious of and make a concerted effort to study with others in groups consistently over the course of the degree programme.</p>
            <h3>Know what you're talking about</h3>
            <p>Following the introduction to computational thinking we touched upon the importance of understanding the history of the web and the context in which we will work in. Coming from a different academic background than computing, I will need to ensure that I build upon my current knowledge of the field so that when I communicate with others (either in an academic or professional environment), I will be able to do so effectively. To do this I will use the resources at my disposal in the library and complete background reading, one book I have already picked up being: “CODE: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software” by Charles Petzold.</p>
            <h3>Clean code is good code</h3>
            <p>We then looked at basic programming skills in HTML & CSS and established what specifically can be achieved by using each language with regards to building a website. I found understanding the syntax and utilising the resources at our disposal on the web to recreate the visual elements of the webpage relatively intuitive and straight forward. However, the element of the task I found most challenging was constructing the code concisely. I recognise the importance of this in scenarios where I will be looking to apply the code across multiple webpages and when I will be working collaboratively with others so they can interpret it clearly. One way I can ensure this is done correctly going forward is by using semantic html whenever possible and referring to the principles outlined <a class="in-text-hyperlink" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/7-important-tips-for-writing-better-css/" >here</a>, specifically; applying the ‘DRY’ principle, descriptive naming of selectors, using shorthands and adding comments to outline the purpose of the blocks of code.</p>
            <h3>Be careful not to waste time</h3>
            <img src="./img/time_management.jpg" alt="A clock indicating time is being monitored">
            <p>After completing the webpage exercise, I became aware of how inefficiently you can spend time on constructing smaller (and possibly insignificant) elements of the webpage and how it is important to remain aware of this. This will be especially important as I tackle larger projects during the course that will require more effective time management. I can improve this going forward by practicing and applying the computational thinking concept of abstraction where I can avoid including unnecessary detail that will not help achieve the goal or solution to the task. </p>
            <h3>Don't jump straight in, take a moment and think... computationally</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, as we have progressed through the module, I have begun to think consciously of the concepts involved in computational thinking when approaching tasks. This very assignment has required the conscious use of computational thinking and it’s four processes. It has reinforced that the best way to approach a problem is not to jump right in and start coding but to take the necessary time to plan and implement the processes involved in thinking computationally which I will apply going forward in the programme.</p>
